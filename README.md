i had to make this anyway for my own texture pack sooo... i figured i may as well clean it up and post it as a resource

on its own, this does nothing, since it is a texture pack that replaces all the sprites in the game with themselves. it is meant to be edited, to remove a lot of the setup from making a texture pack from scratch

idk if the code is 100% cause im not a lua user but i havent had any issues with it... yet... i used the steamodded example mods as reference

get steamodded here https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded

HOW TO USE:
- just edit the textures in your image editor of choice, make sure to copy your edits between the 1x and 2x folder, just upscale your 1x stuff by 200% and put it in 2x
- keep the freakin image dimensions the same as the originals or you might break something!!!
- if you delete an image, you will need to remove any lines referencing it from the lua file
- once you want to test it, just install it in the same way as any other mod
